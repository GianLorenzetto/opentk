# OpenTK Playground

Hi, this is my [OpenTK](https://opentk.net/index.html) playground.

Currently I'm creating my own implementation of the [Learn OpenTK tutorials](https://opentk.net/learn/index.html), but with some of my own tweaks and fixes.

The goal is to eventually create a simple, easy to use visualization engine.

If you're curious, look through the commit history to see the code for each chapter in the learning series.

## Requirements

You'll need [dotnet core installed](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) for your platform.

## Running

To run, clone this repo then open a terminal at the top-level folder and execute the command

```c#
dotnet run
```

A window will hopefully open showing a pretty boring scene right now. You can move the camera around with the `A, W, S, D, Space, LShift` keys and by moving the mouse. Scroll the mouse to zoom.

That's it!
