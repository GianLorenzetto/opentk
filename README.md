# OpenTK Playground

Hi, this is my [OpenTK](https://opentk.net/index.html) playground.

Currently I'm creating my own implementation of the [Learn OpenTK tutorials](https://opentk.net/learn/index.html), but with some of my own tweaks and fixes.

The goal is to eventually create a simple, easy to use visualisation engine.

If you're curious, look through the commit history to see the code for each chapter in the learning series.
